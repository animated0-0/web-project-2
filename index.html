        <p class="small-words">
        Treaty 5, signed in 1875, is distinct from other Canadian treaties due to its individualized negotiation approach, smaller reserve allocations, lower financial provisions, inclusion of water rights, and delayed boundary clarifications.

        <h2>How is the Treaty being implemented today?</h2>
        <p class="small-words">
        Treaty 5 is realized in the form of such urban reserves as Kapyong in Winnipeg and the Long Plain First Nation gas station that create jobs and economic opportunity. 
        Such projects and land entitlement agreements promote growth and development of the communities.
